 USAGE of provided library:
 
       require_once ('code128barcode.class.php')
       $barcode = new code128barcode();
       
       $code = $barcode->output('code string');
       ...
       $code = $barcode->output('another code string');
       ...
       $barcode->nozerofill = true;
       $barcode->unoptimized = true;
       $code = $barcode->output('laposte colissimo code string');
       ...

 $code is a (decimal) 1 and 0 suit, '1' represents black bar
 and 0 white.

 ten 0 before and after string represents silent zones. Note
 it can be not sufficient, as the minimal silent zone is
 6.35mm (1/4 ").
 These leading and trailing zero can be disabled by setting
 $barcode->nozerofill = true;

 Additionnaly, there is a variable "unoptimized". When setting
 it to false, barcodes coplies with "french laposte colissimo"
 standard.
